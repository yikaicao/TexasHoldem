# TexasHoldem
Prototype for Texas Hold'em game in Java with implemented interfaces for a card and a hand.

This project contains the set of classes and interfaces one would need to implement the functionality of a generic card game. The method signatures and member variables are listed in the header of every file. This project is particularly designed for Texas Hold'em game. However, the interfaces can be used as a generic resource for building other card games. The only assumption it makes is one pokerhand has 5 cards. And it is implemented just to test if the other interfaces would work together for an online casino.
